	<p>This site is a collection of stories from a traveler, who also happens to be a designer and a web developer. By passing my experiences through that particular lens, I hope to share a few interesting reflections on my journey. Unlike most travel blogs, however, I won't be telling you where to go on your vacation. That's for you to decide. My only hope is that I inspire you to get out and follow your path, wherever it might lead.</p>
