			<p>This site is (or will be...soon) a collection of stories from a traveler, who also happens to be a designer and a web developer. By passing my experiences through that particular lens, I hope to share a few interesting reflections on my journey. Unlike most travel blogs, however, I won't be telling you where to spend your holiday or where to go on your vacation. That's for you to decide. My only hope is that I inspire someone to get out and follow their path, wherever it might lead.</p>
