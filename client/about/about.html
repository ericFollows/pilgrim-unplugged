<h4>WHY (did I start this site?)</h4>
    <p>{pilgrim: unplugged} is an experiment in using my talents to explore my passions, and share that experience with the people I care about. I find the process of writing helps me to better organize my mental stuffs, and composing my thoughts (clearly enough for others to follow, at least) often helps reveal angles I hadn't considered. Documenting an experience has the potential to remove you from what's happening, but it also has the ability to focus the lens on aspects you might have otherwise missed. I'm hopping this project will make use of the opportunities I have in front of me, and offer the results for others to participate in.</p>

<h4>HOW (am I documenting the experience?)</h4>
    

<h4>WHAT (is the focus of the project?)</h4>
    <p>This is a crossroads of my personal interests. The role of human creativity amidst this modern tech revolution is becoming increasingly crucial to our mental and emotional well-being, and as close as social-media has brought us, it's still so easy to overlook the underlying nature of human consciousness common to all people around the world. Traveling to new places allows us to see how similar we all truly are.</p>

<h4>WHO (am I to talk about any of this?)</h4>
     <p>I graduated from the College for Creative Studies after five years of training in visual art and design, with a Bachelors of Fine Art. In the same year I finished a Yoga teacher training program with an RYT200 certificate, and briefly taught Ashtanga in Chicago before moving to South Korea to teach ESL. After living abroad and traveling for five years, I learned to write code for web development with a renewed fervor to put my creative talents to use once again.</p>

<h4>WHERE & WHEN</h4>
    <p>These might seem obvious, but the where is anywhere I happen to go, and the when is anytime I have a thought I feel is worth sharing.</p>
